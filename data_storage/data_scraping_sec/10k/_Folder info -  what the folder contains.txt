What this folder (data_scraping_sec) contains: 
Data-tables scraped from sec.gov/EDGAR based on stock_list 

- 10K forms, divided into different csv files based on the selected tables in that form, tagged with an R-tag:

	R1: Cover page
	R2: Statement of consolidated Operations
	R3: Statement of consolidated Comprehensive Income
	R4: Colsolidated Balance sheet
	R5: Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows
	R6: Stateent of Changes in Colsolidated Equity
		Due to some firms having additional tables in between their financial statements,
		we need to add a few extra numbers, just to make sure we get the previously mentioned tables:
	R7: [extra]
	R8: [extra]
	R9: [extra]
		The extra tables not listed above will be filtered out and deleted. 
	
	The csv-files are categorised as follows: 
		symbol	year	form 	R-tag
		aapl	2021	10-K 	R2
		=> aapl_2021_10-K_R2.CSV



		PROBLEM: 
		Due to this, there wil be a inconsistancy where some tables will be marked with the wrong R-tag.
		E.g. normally it would look like this: 
			R2: Statement of consolidated Operations
			R3: Statement of consolidated Comprehensive Income
		But if these extra tables should occor, it will end up looking like this:
			R2: Statement of consolidated Operations
			R3: Statement of consolidated Operations (Parenthetical)
			R4: Statement of consolidated Comprehensive Income
		Now, the whole list gets shifted and R4 which should only contain "Balance sheets", not contain +1 "Comprehensive Income"
		So the code need to be changed, or we need to make a filter-code that sorts them out properly.
